The difficulty was compunded for the remote controller because its sensitivity made it very hard to make gradual, gentle movements. On the other hand, the wearable interface without haptics was much better at making gradual movements. However, the problem of determining the relative position of the drone to the obstacle was not resolved until haptic feedback was provided.  ","Very interesting experiment! It would be worth exploring the differences in performance between first and third person control. Also, I would recommend replacing the mouse for a simpler, lightweight click button that people can hold more easily. "

If zou approaching to fast, zou do not have time to integrate the vibrations and adapt the control.","Reallz good experiment, well conducted, instructions are easz to understand."

It also requires less concentration to fly with it. "
