Adding more vibrational elements to the glove (or even making arrays of them if they are smaller) might be useful. The controller could be also integrated in the glove, I guess."

Liked an idea of this glove. Sure, it will find an application."
"2019/08/13 5:22:01 PM UTC+2","25","Female","3","1","Wearable","9","Werable","Because the vibrations help in knowing how close you are to the objective. If not, it is quite difficult to measure the depth (it is more trial and error and depends on the size of the robot)","I believe it is hard to measure the depth mostly when the robot has no shadow. The vibrations are a good way to help in the successful of the task, nevertheless sometimes the wearable could more difficult to control since you don't have the actions separately (go up, down, left, right, forward, backwards, as you can have it with the joystick)  "

The haptic glove was very helpful, expecially in tasks 2 and 3"
"2019/08/13 6:39:57 PM UTC+2","21","Male","10","1","Wearable","10","Werable","Physical feedback compensated the lack of vision I had. Without any change in the viewpoint and the haptic ,it was really difficult if not impossible, to do the tasks with the controller.","The haptic interface was really good. It could help to change the position of the motors on the gloves considering the position of the while in control. To have them correspond more with the spatial coordinates."
"2019/08/22 5:06:02 PM UTC+2","28","Male","7","1","Remote controller","9","Remote controller","Spatial control felt easier with the remote controller because x y z displacements are very straight forward, whereas it is more clumsy by hand. However, the existence and location of obstacles was made very clear with the haptic feedback. ","For the obstacles used in this experiment, I think a basic vibrating remote controller (say, like the one of the PS4) would have been sufficient to succeed in the tasks, indeed, I think the 6-way directionality of the haptic feedback felt like an overkill for these obstacles.

"2019/08/22 6:04:56 PM UTC+2","28","Male","9","8","Wearable","10","Werable","I preferred the haptic feedback, as the depth perception was felt as well as seen. The obstacles were very difficult with no haptic feedback!","This system would be especially useful when your vision is impaired, such as if the drone is far away, or if you are blind in one eye. The haptic control of the drone was a little jerky vs the remote controller. It was initially counter intuitive given I have used an xbox style controller before, but it was quick/easy to learn."

It helps clearing obstacles much more easily.","The haptic feedback + control with the hand makes the whole experience quite intuitive and fun. I am definitely more confident with the haptic feedback."
