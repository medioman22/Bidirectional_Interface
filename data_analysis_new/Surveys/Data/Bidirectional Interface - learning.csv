"2019/07/18 12:04:17 PM UTC+2","24","Male","10","5","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","Easier to mix different directions (up, left and forward at the same time for example)","At first Wearable was confusing because I tried to clutch/unclutch a lot to get more precise using iteration the same way as I would do with the joysticks. But This method was not working well. I noticed that doing a long travel without unclutching is way more efficient. Wearable is more intuitive than joysticks. Joysticks were confusing (using the wrong joystick for the wrong purpose)"
"2019/07/18 1:55:45 PM UTC+2","23","Male","4","1","Equivalent","Remote controller","Werable","Less sensible than the controller, therefore more precise","I think there is a different input sensitivity between the controller and the wearable, which makes the controller much harder to master"
"2019/07/18 2:58:28 PM UTC+2","20","Male","4","3","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","The control is more natural with hand movements than with a joystick","Nice experience"
"2019/07/18 3:19:15 PM UTC+2","20","Male","3","2","Wearable","Wearable","Werable","Le controle est plus naturel en position avec le wearable, il y a beaucoup de depassement de consigne avec la commande avec la manette","le systeme wearable etait rapide a prendre en main et plus precis sur la commande du drone"
"2019/07/25 2:30:49 PM UTC+2","23","Male","7","9","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","more intuitive ","i had to bring back my hand closed to my body"
"2019/07/25 3:04:13 PM UTC+2","22","Female","3","2","Wearable","Wearable","Werable","easier to use. stops more quickly when need to change direction","the obstacles at the back of the room were much more hard to get"
"2019/07/25 6:53:46 PM UTC+2","25","Male","10","1","Wearable","Wearable","Werable","It is more intuitive","It feel nice to control with the wearable, but anyway, for both controllers, the perspective of the dimension of the obstacles is complicated "
"2019/07/25 7:35:43 PM UTC+2","25","Female","2","1","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","Werable is controlled with a single hand","More inertia in the remote, maybe affected the experience"
"2019/08/07 6:02:22 PM UTC+2","29","Female","9","5","Equivalent","Wearable","Werable","more fun, more intuitive (I did not have to think to the right handle to move as from the beginning)","I think that the gain of the wearable can be tuned better, but it seems very promosing :)"
"2019/08/08 11:07:35 AM UTC+2","30","Male","8","7","Wearable","Wearable","Werable","The joystick had a mapping of the inputs/outputs which is not what I am used to with drones. Therefore, I needed to get used to it and then the task got easier. Instead, with the wearable, I expected immediately that if I moved my hand up the drone would go up etc.","In my opinion, the main problem related to the wearable interface is getting used to the clutch and how its use impacts the task completion.

If a gate is successfully crossed, maybe change its colour to green"

"2019/08/22 9:40:57 AM UTC+2","24","Male","10","10","Equivalent","Equivalent","Werable","It is cooler and more innovative. ","Controlling the drone with wearable control was nice. For the precise maneuvers it would be nice to have unidirectional mode when the drone is allowed to fly in one direction estimated by the general moving arm direction. "
"2019/08/22 10:44:26 AM UTC+2","32","Male","5","1","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","naturally controlled with less thinking","fun to control a drone with hand movement"

"2019/08/22 1:16:25 PM UTC+2","25","Male","8","4","Remote controller","Remote controller","Remote controller","With the wearable controller, you have to pay some physical efforts and the control of the hand in 3d space is not that accurate. For a remote controller, we get used to it since childhood when we play video games.","The drones could be more stable and control of it should be more accurate."
"2019/08/28 10:36:38 AM UTC+2","28","Male","8","9","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","Because with the wearable you could make much more smooth and precise movement than the remote controller which it felt like drone kept overshooting the position I wanted it to be in. ","I found the task easier with multiple tries and this made using the remote easier as I used it after the wearable. I think the wearable is much more accurate and intuitive but if one wanted to maximize the speed at which you could complete the course, I believe the remote control would be easier with more practice, as you don`t need to keep re-clicking."
"2019/08/28 12:53:38 PM UTC+2","31","Male","5","1","Remote controller","Wearable","Werable","It seemed to be more natural after a while ","I prefer the wearable but it needs some effort for training and then it seems better choice"
"2019/08/28 2:28:56 PM UTC+2","25","Female","5","1","Wearable","Wearable","Werable","It's easier to use it and to learn. The movements are smoother","The test starts on the right and my impression was that it was more difficut to controle it in the sides"
"2019/08/28 3:02:28 PM UTC+2","24","Male","10","3","Remote controller","Equivalent","Werable","Wearable is much more fun to use","Wearable seemed more precise and definitely more fun, but a bit too tiring for me"
"2019/08/28 4:23:22 PM UTC+2","24","Male","7","1","Wearable","Wearable","Werable","more intuitive and more fun","the controller had some inertia that took some mental effort to take into account. The wearable controller is cool but I to move the drone on longer distances I had to do repetitive movements which took some time"
